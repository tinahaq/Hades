            <h1>The Gameplay of Hades</h1>
            <p>Hades is an isometric dungeon-crawler rogue-lite with mechanics that are revealed over time. The first mechanic is Nyx's Mirror of Night, whereby the protagonist Zagreus gains enough 'Darkness' to upgrade his abilities and change between sets at will. There are six weapon-based playstyles that Zagreus gains as he continues to fight: sword, spear, shield, bow and arrow, fist as well as a repeating rifle. The Olympians also give special boons out in the dungeon that switch up the style of play drastically, and Zagreus can gain 'Keepsakes' by offering the Olympians nectar (and later, ambrosia).</p>
            <p>However, nectar and ambrosia have other roles in the game, and that is of gifts offered to the characters in Hades's household when Zagreus dies and comes back to life. The actions performed in the household are important to the gameplay and the storyline, thus wrapping the game up in an almost perfect blend of story-telling and gameplay.</p>
