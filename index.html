            <h1>What is Hades?</h1>            
            <p>According to the blurb on Supergiant Games' website, "Hades is a rogue-like dungeon crawler in which you defy the god of the dead as you hack and slash your way out of the Underworld of Greek myth." More specifically however, Hades is actually a <strong>rogue-lite</strong> dungeon crawler based on Orphic Greek mythology, as delineated by its progression mechanics that build on top of each other.</p>
            <p>Hades was first released back in December 2018 in early access on Steam, and was fully released in September 17 2020 on Microsoft Windows, macOS and the Nintendo Switch. Further releases on the PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S are slated for August 13, 2021 (at least, according to Wikipedia).</p>
