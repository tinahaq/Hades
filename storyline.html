            <h1>The Storyline of Hades</h1>
            <p><em>Hades</em> follows the story of Zagreus, the son of Hades and Nyx. Bored of his provincial life in the deepest depths of Tartarus, this son of Hades decides to call it quits one day (or evening, or night--it's hard to tell when you're undead) and goes out into the wider Underworld to hack and slash his way out of there. With the help of his mother Nyx, his Olympian relatives and a skeleton named Skelly, Zagreus attempts to break out of the prison he was born into, repeatedly dying in the process.</p>
            <p>However, the actual storyline is much deeper, involving politics amongst the gods, romance, parental relationships and Zagreus's own personal growth as a protagonist. The storyline is given out in bits and pieces--you're rewarded for fighting (and dying) well, and each conversation you have usually has something to do with your in-game actions. Every single mechanic not only affects the gameplay in significant ways, but also often earns comments from the other characters you are surrounded by, with one of the simplest being Zagreus and Hades fighting over Zagreus's choice of decor later in the game.</p>
            <p>This is definitely a game to be experienced rather than told, and giving out any more of the storyline would be spoiler territory. Go play it for yourselves!</p>
